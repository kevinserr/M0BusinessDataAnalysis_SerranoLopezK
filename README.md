# Business Data Analysis

**Business Scenario & Problem :**

<p>I work for a video game company. Recently we have seen a decline in sales. I've been 
tasked with finding ways to maximize our sales through targeted marketing. I have a
dataset with a breakdown of sales by region and genre.  <p>

**Potential Questions**
<p>What countries/regions should we focus on? What genre of games should we focus on?<p>
