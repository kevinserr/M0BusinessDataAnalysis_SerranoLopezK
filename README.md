# Business Data Analysis

**Business Scenario & Problem :**

<p>I work for a video game company. Recently we have seen a decline in sales. I've been 
tasked with finding ways to maximize our sales through targeted marketing. I have a
dataset with a breakdown of sales by region and genre.  <p>

**Potential Questions**
<p>What countries/regions should we focus on? What genre of games should we focus on?<p>

**2. Data Life Cycle** <p><p>

**3. Excel Analysis**
<p>For my excel analysis I created a pivot table that displayed the different regions as columns
and genres as rows. From this we can see how much a particular genre sold and in which region it was most successful.
Using sum I calculated the total sales per genre and region. From this table I was able to create a bar chart
showing the number of sales per genre regardless of region.</p>

**4. Python Analysis**
<p>For the python analysis I used pandas to open the csv file and turn it into a DataFrame.
With this DataFrame I'm  able to show the total sales per region. Using the mathlib library I was able to generate a bar graph showing
the sales by region. </p>
